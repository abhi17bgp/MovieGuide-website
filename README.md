## 📄 Project Description

**MovieGuide** is a simple web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to search for movies and view detailed information like title, poster, genre, rating, and overview. The app fetches real-time data from **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** and is styled for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

This project was created as part of a learning journey to explore API integration and dynamic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.
